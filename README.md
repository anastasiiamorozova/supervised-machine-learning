A draft model for the future investigation

This is a test model for recognizing drug content in Telegram messages. Primarily a Logistic Regression model has been trained for binary classification. Text data was converted to numeric values using the Tfidf Vectorizer, considering term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). This transformation enables the model to learn patterns and relationships between words. To take tasks with multiple possible labels into consideration, a MultiOutputClassifier was employed as an extension. One-Hot Encoding was used for multi-label transformation. 

For now it's trained on a sample of 100 messages generated by ChatGPT. The model labels messages by category: drugs, non-drugs, price, delivery.

Later we will adapt it to analyse the content of Russian and Polish channels on Telegram. Performance will be evaluated with Hamming Loss test, a metric suitable for multi-label classification.


The investigation is inspired by the work of our Dutch colleagues from NOS: https://huggingface.co/nosdigitalmedia/telegram-drugs-classification/tree/main
